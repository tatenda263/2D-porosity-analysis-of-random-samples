Porosity and Permeability Assessment in Randomly Generated 3D Savonni√®res Carbonate Samples

The high-value samples from random-3D-sample-generator were then analysed using open-source tools.

The first analysis was the porosity of each sample.
Aim was to quantify the absolute and effective porosities of each sample.

The BoneJ plugin in Fiji-ImageJ was used to determine the following parameters:

Pore shape - using the surface area to volume ratio
Connectivity - using the Euler characteristics
Pore Size Distribution - using the difference between the largest and smallest pores

The table showing the results is shown below. 
1st Column - Sample number and the coordinates for each sample
2nd Column - Number of voxels in largest connected pore space
3rd Column - Size of the smallest disconnected pore space
4th Column - The size of the median disconnected pore space
5th Column - The pore distribution, with "W" denoting "Wide"
