# porosity-analysis-of-random-samples
Porosity Assessment in Randomly Generated 3D Savonni√®res Carbonate Samples

The high-value samples from random-3D-sample-generator were then analysed using open-source tools.

The first analysis was the porosity of each sample.
Aim was to quantify the absolute and effective porosities of each sample.

First tool used was the **BoneJ plugin** in Fiji-ImageJ
The following parameters were determined:/n
Pore shape - using the surface area to volume ratio
Connectivity - using the Euler characteristics
Pore Size Distribution - using the difference between the largest and smallest pores

The table of results is shown below. 
1st Column - Sample number and the coordinates for each sample
2nd Column - Number of voxels in largest connected pore space
3rd Column - Size of the smallest disconnected pore space
4th Column - The size of the median disconnected pore space
5th Column - The amount of pore space attributed to the largest interconnected space
6th Column - The pore distribution, with "W" denoting "Wide"

Second tool used was **Python**

Porosity for each sample was calculated as follows in _porosity_:
Porosity = Total Pore Voxels/Total Number of Voxels
The results for each sample were then plotted on a graph.
